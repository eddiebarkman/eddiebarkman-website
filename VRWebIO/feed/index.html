<p>Technically speaking it&#8217;s been live for a little over a week now. But I&#8217;ve been endlessly tinkering around with every line of code within the site, trying to get it perfect before publicizing it.</p>
<p><em>VRWeb.IO is a virtual reality web design studio</em>. It is the result of me wanting to jump into the world of virtual reality. My past mainly revolves around web design and when I started working with VR in the browser I knew it was going would become  something amazing and worth jumping into. So I decided I was done waiting for the future to begin on its own and do something about it myself.</p>
<p>My main goal is to bring VR Web Design to businesses, people, organizations, groups and whoever else interested in it both locally and beyond. It may take some time but I firmly believe that virtual reality is a new platform that will take off, much like mobile web a few years back, and people are going to want VR content!</p>
<p>I hope to begin adding more to  my portfolio page into the future as I come up with new ideas or maybe even make some websites. I&#8217;ve only got a couple at the moment but if you&#8217;re interested go check them out!</p>
<h4>So where does it go from here?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ll try to write posts every once in a while about new things related with VR or VR on the web but nothing as in-depth as a news site. I also really want to start getting involved with the VR community, web related, games, experiences, videos and whatever else is out there. <strong>We are all in this together as early birds to the upcoming VR revolution</strong>. <em>So feel free to message me or add me on social media</em>!</p>
<h5>Oh just a little side note if you missed it, the front page of <a href="http://www.vrweb.io">vrweb.io</a> is actually VR capable. If you view it on your phone you can look around or just click and drag the image. I bring it up because it&#8217;s my first attempt at integrating Virtual Reality Web with traditional and mobile web.</h5>
